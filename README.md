Puppet module for configuring PostgreSQL installations for optimal performance.

Heavily based on web version of [PgTune] utility by Alexey Vasiliev aka @le0pard. _Note: not all functionality is implemented yet._

Please note that such autoconfiguration is not absolutely optimal in every case and should be considered as "quick start" solution. Most probably at some point of time you will stop use this module and will pick `postgresql::server::config_entry` definitions from its `init.pp` with values optimal for you.


Installation
------------

### Using [librarian-puppet] _(recommended)_

Place in your `Puppetfile`

	mod 'Envek-pgtune'

And execute

	librarian-puppet install

### Just to install

Type on your Puppet master command:

	puppet module install Envek-pgtune

Usage
-----

To configure by default:

	include pgtune

To limit memory for PostgreSQL by a half of installed RAM:

	class { "pgtune":
		available_memory_mb => $memorysize_mb / 2,
	}

To specify database purpose and desired connection limit:

	class { "pgtune":
		$max_connections => 150,
		$db_type         => 'web',
	}

### Available DB types

 * `web`     - Web applications
 * `oltp`    - Online transaction processing systems
 * `dw`      - Data warehouses
 * `desktop` - Desktop applications
 * `mixed`   - Mixed type of applications (this is default)
